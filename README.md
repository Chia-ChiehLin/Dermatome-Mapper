The Dermatome Mapper application is designed to assist physicians and help those learning about spinal nerve distribution
in a more visually appealing way compared to using an online image. This app will include an interactive map of the human
bodyâ€™s dermatome, specifically looking at the lumbar nerves L1-L5.  When a specific spinal nerve is selected, important information
is displayed about it, such as muscle innervation and possible deficits associated with the nerve. Users will be able to search for a
deficit that they have and be able to see the associated nerve distribution. The application will also include a navigation bar for users
to use to visit different pages, such as the Glossary and About pages.
